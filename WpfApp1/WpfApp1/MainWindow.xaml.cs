My name is Kodak but you know that already I don't want the wap baby I just want the fetty Polo to the socks homie this ain't Perry Ellis Let me get the raw I'm a ball like spaghetti

[Verse 1]
She walked up to me, I was by the bar, she was like hello
She rolled up on me, I was rollin up my cigarillo
No I don't fuck with Grabba leaf I'm breaking down the elpo
I'm always smoking loud I can't keep it on the LO
Girl I don't like the way your booty flop, it's like jello
And now I'm rockin Robin Jeans remember wearing Ecko
She say she just came to chill look bitch this ain't a Getty
I told that bitch get outta here, act like you never met me
I'm up the road I'm lurking for them books, no library
Lil niggas state - to - state I get more cake than lil Debbie
No I can't save a hoe I'm no neighborhood hero
Keep that shit 1K I can't be fuckin wit a zero

[Hook]
My name is Kodak but you know that already
I don't want the wap baby I just want the fetty
Polo to the socks homie this ain't Perry Ellis
Let me get the raw I'mma ball like spaghetti
It's getting hot in here the block be hot no not Nelly
You can keep the Rari, I'd rather have a Chevy
I don't want no head lately I've been getting becky
I just want the bread, keep the peanut butter jelly


[Verse 2]
Boy I need that green bought my green no asparagus
Lord forgive me please cut the money I just cherished it
Hit a mean lick I took that money and I buried it
She get on her knees OMG that's embarassing
I don't need no record deal but you gon hear my record still
Me and DJ on the pill we spinning like a ferris wheel
Oh that's Kodak Black who they be talking bout,that's the nigga
First I had to grow to be the man like a caterpillar
Once that jit was old enough to thug it he was thuggin
He just found a strap now he cut you like it's nothing
I use to pour fours now I pour a whole dozen
Bumped into Lil Wally in the hood, hey cousin

[Hook]
My name is Kodak but you know that already
